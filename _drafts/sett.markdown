title: Setting up Sublime Text for LaTeX on Arch Linux
---

This is just a quick note to myself and others (if google picks this up) about how I was able to get a LaTeX editing environment with sublime text on Arch Linux with Gnome 3. YMMV

The process can be broken down into a series of steps, each not being that difficult 

* Installing Sublime-Text from the AUR.
* Setting up package control for sublime.
* Installing LaTeX-tools

Each of these steps have been documented elsewhere but with one important omission (the linux docs assume Ubuntu) and a couple of changes.
