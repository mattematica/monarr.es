Hello all,

I set up this site to be a central location for things that I'd like to share with both my students and the world. However as it has migrated from different blogging platforms I have found that this is as much a forum for me to play around with new things. Right now this site is a [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) site hosted on [Digital Ocean](https://www.digitalocean.com/) using some [Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com) to make it all responsive. As I get better with css, javascript and the many front end frameworks the site should hopefull evolve into something interesting. 

Be seeing you,
