Hello Math 200 students, 

The [learning center ](http://www.canadacollege.edu/learningcenter/) has created a [new page ](http://www.canadacollege.edu/learningcenter/statistics.php) to consolidate some useful information for you.

It contains links for 

* the updated workshop schedule, 
* various on-line probability calculators, and
* [frank's you tube videos](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCj8kKpIkPhwy6on6iai5x5Q). 

So go ahead and [check it out ](http://www.canadacollege.edu/learningcenter/statistics.php) and tell me what you think.
