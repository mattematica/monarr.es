Frank over in the [math lab](http://canadacollege.edu/learningcenter/mathlab.php) has started making videos covering some of the basics of our math 200 class.

Particularly relevent to our class right now are a couple that teach you how to make a frequency distribution and histogram from a list of data. Check them out below!
