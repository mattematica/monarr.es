It turns out that I like to set up the software behind blogs more than I like to actually like to write entries for them. After evaluating [Nikola](http://getnikola.com/), a blogging platform that generates static pages for upload, I found that I was just too used to the workflow on [Ghost](https://ghost.org/) and [Word Press](https://wordpress.com/). (Though messing around with the themes make me want to learn more about bootstap and css in general.) So to stop myself from doing another project that begins but is never really used, I decided to not follow the path of switching out monarr.es to a new system and just start using this more often. So hopefully this means that I will use this site for more than just a place to dump [dropbox](http://www.dropbox.com) links for my students. I hope that it can be interesting...
