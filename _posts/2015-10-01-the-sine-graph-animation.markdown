Hello all,

Go ahead and click on the picture below to play around with the animation that I showed in class today:

<a title="View with the Desmos Graphing Calculator" href="https://www.desmos.com/calculator/rjk54l49pj">  <img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/calc_thumbs/production/rjk54l49pj.png" width="200px" height="200px"     style="border:1px solid #ccc; border-radius:5px"  /></a>

I would consider giving bonus points to the person who can adapt, and explain, how to change this animation so that it shows the graph of cosine. See you all in class today!
